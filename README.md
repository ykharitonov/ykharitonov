Coder | C & JavaScript enjoyer

Привет! 👋 I’m Yulian or Julian (Юлиан), some guy from Russia who likes to write code in C and JavaScript (and sometimes suffer because of it, but it’s fine). I do low-level stuff in C when I feel smart, and then switch to JavaScript when I want to make shiny things on the web. Balance, right? )

On GitHub, I mostly upload my experiments, half-finished projects, and things I do to avoid doing real work. But hey, maybe someone will find them useful (or at least funny). I like open-source because it’s like sharing your homework with the whole world, but cooler.

When I’m not coding, I’m probably drinking tea, reading docs (or memes), or trying to figure out why my code works but I don’t know why. Feel free to poke me if you want to chat about tech, life, or why JavaScript is weird but we still love it.

Let’s make something cool together! Or just laugh at my code, that’s fine too )

Stuff I use:

- Languages: C (for the hardcore vibes), JavaScript (for the chaos), sometimes TypeScript (to feel professional)

- Tools: Git (because I break things a lot), Linux (because Windows is scary), Docker (magic boxes, basically)

- Interests: Embedded stuff, web things, algorithms (when I’m feeling brave), and cats (always)

“If it works, don’t touch it. If it doesn’t, Google it.” ✌️
